    <p>Bitcoins are limited in quantity.<br>
      It is often compared to gold in the way that the money is released into the world in a continuous and decreased rate, like gold mining.<br>
      There will <strong>never be more than 21 million bitcoins</strong> in existence and every four years the amount of bitcoins released is halved, until the last bitcoin is released around year 2140.<br>
      This is done by a mathematical algorithm, not a person.</p>
    <h4>Bitcoins are created at will out of thin air</h4>
    <p>Bitcoins are created as a reward for those who help verify <strong class="title has-tooltip" title="For example, verify that you have enough bitcoins to send before transferring them">valid transactions</strong> in the Bitcoin network.<br>
      This process is called <a data-reveal-id="mining-info-modal" class="fix-link-background">Bitcoin mining</a> and takes care of the accounting of the economy.</p>
