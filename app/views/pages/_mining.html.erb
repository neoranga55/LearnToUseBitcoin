  <p>The term Bitcoin mining is used to describe how bitcoins are created and secured<br>
    The metaphor with gold mining refers to the fact that bitcoins are <strong>limited in supply like gold</strong><br>
    Nevertheless, the actual process of Bitcoin mining is more similar to a <strong>lottery</strong> system than to a gold mine</p>
  <h4>Goals of mining</h4>
  <h5>Verify transactions in the Bitcoin ledger (the Blockchain)</h5>
  <p>The miners perfom the <strong>accounting role</strong> of the Bitcoin economy. For example, they make sure your Bitcoin address contains 
    enough bitcoins before sending them and also verify that you don't send the same bitcoins to two persons simultaneously</p>
  <h5>Create and distribute new bitcoins</h5>
  <p>Every 10 minutes (on average) a miner creates a new block that <strong>confirms</strong> the last transactions in the Bitcoin economy and this block becomes part of the Blockchain, forever<br>
    This new block contains new bitcoins that go to the miner's Bitcoin address as a reward for performing the accounting work</p>
  To understand how a miner gets a reward you have to learn who the lottery reward works with Proof of Work
