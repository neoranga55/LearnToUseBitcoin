  <p>The term Bitcoin mining is used to describe how bitcoins are created and secured<br>
    The analogy with gold mining refers to the fact that bitcoins are <strong>limited in supply like gold</strong><br>
    Nevertheless, the actual process of Bitcoin mining is more similar to a <strong>lottery</strong> system than to a gold mine</p>
  
  <h4>Goals of mining</h4>
  
  <h5><label class="fake-circle-button"> 1 </label>Verify transactions in the Bitcoin ledger (the Blockchain)</h5>
  <p>The miners perform the <strong>accounting role</strong> of the Bitcoin economy<br>
    For example, they make sure your Bitcoin address contains enough bitcoins before sending them and also verify that you don't send the same bitcoins to two persons simultaneously</p>
  
  <h5><label class="fake-circle-button"> 2 </label>Create and distribute new bitcoins</h5>
  <p>Every 10 minutes (on average) a miner creates a new block that <strong>confirms</strong> the last transactions in the Bitcoin economy and this block becomes part of the Blockchain, forever<br>
    This new block contains new minted bitcoins that go to the miner's Bitcoin address as a reward for performing the accounting work</p>
