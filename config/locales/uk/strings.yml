  myths: Myths about Bitcoin
  myths_1: Money only works because there is a government backing it
  myths_2_html: |
    There is no government, corporation or legal entity backing Bitcoin which may make difficult to understand how can the currency be trustworthy.<br>
    Bitcoin solves this by moving trust away from organizations and persons whose interests can be influenced to a unique <strong>trust in math</strong>.<br>
    Similar to the way gold provides trust through a series of unique physical attributes that are difficult to imitate correctly,
    Bitcoin uses algorithms to prove that money belongs only to the owner of a private key and can only be spent once.
  myths_3: Everything in Bitcoin is anonymous
  myths_4_html: |
    Bitcoin is not anonymous, it protects your privacy like cash.<br>
    Similar to cash where your name is not present in the bills that you use, in Bitcoin it is not possible to see your name in the bitcoins that you send or receive,
    but if you reveal your identity to the person or company that receives the bitcoins, it is possible to link your identity with your transaction
    and since all transactions are linked and publicly stored in the Blockchain, it is possible to partially track some of the previous transactions you made with the same
  bitcoin_address: Bitcoin address
  myths_4_tooltip: The Wallet software will easily create and manage new addresses for you
  myths_5: Bitcoins are digital and I could copy them like digital music
  myths_6_html: |
    Bitcoins are limited in quantity.<br>
    It is often compared to gold in the way that the money is released into the world in a continuous and decreased rate, like gold mining.<br>
    There will <strong>never be more than 21 million bitcoins</strong> in existence and every four years the amount of bitcoins released is halved, until the last bitcoin is released around year 2140.<br>
    This is done by a mathematical algorithm, not a person.
  myths_7: Bitcoins are created at will out of thin air
  myths_8_1: Bitcoins are created as a reward for those who help verify
  valid_transactions: valid transactions
  valid_transactions_tooltip: For example, verify that you have enough bitcoins to send before transferring them
